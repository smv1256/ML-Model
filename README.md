# Predicting county household income from socioeconomic data.

My AP Stat capstone sparked some interest, so I whipped up this model to predict average household income based on county socioeconomic data (taken from a Kaggle dataset using a Harvard census). Turns out that even if you use way more data than just unemployment rate--not to mention making it a census of the entire US instead of an in-state SRS--the rÂ² is only 0.65. Interesting!

I have finals starting from tomorrow, but I spend my time doing this. Yay!
